# Examples

This directory contains a number of examples which demonstrate the use of the `cobalt_aws::lambda` module.

To run these examples local, you will need to have [LocalStack installed](EXAMPLE). You can then run the script:


```shell
./scripts/run_example.sh
```

To read the output logs of the lambda, run the script:

```shell
./scripts/read_logs.sh
```
