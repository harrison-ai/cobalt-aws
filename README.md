# The Cobalt AWS wrapper library

This library provides a collection of wrappers around the [aws-sdk-rust](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-rust) and [lambda_runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime) packages.

These wrappers are intended to make it easier to perform common tasks when developing applications which run on AWS infrastructure.
